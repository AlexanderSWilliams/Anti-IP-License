# Anti-IP License
**Draft version**:  The license that will maximize intellectual property rights inclusivity.

**Purpose**

The community of people that choose to license their rights under this document and comply with its requirements should expect that no one in the community will seek a judicial remedy for intellectual property infringement from them and that any such claim will be judged in favor of the defendant(s).  To protect their cultural, literary, artistic, scientific, industrial, economic, and moral interests in their intellectual property those that license their rights under this document are expected to use voluntary arbitration, explicit contracts, insurance, 3rd party certification, ostracism, boycotting, reputation, marketing, private unions, and other voluntary measures not involving courts of law.

**Definitions**

A "Person" ("People") refers to an individual or entity.

A "Licensor" refers to a Person granting permissions under this license.

A "Restricted Action" in a given jurisdiction is an action that if performed would infringe on a Licensor's IP if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

"You" ("Your") refers to a Person that performed or is performing a Restricted Action.

"IP" in a given jurisdiction refers to all exclusive rights that are recognized as intellectual property in that jurisdiction.  Depending on the jurisdiction, these rights include but are not limited to industrial property such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, service marks, layout-designs, commercial names and designations, geographical indications, anti-circumvention, and protection against unfair competition in addition to copyright, authors' rights, moral rights, related rights, database rights, data rights, publicity rights, privacy rights, all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields, and all rights with similar intent that exist now or in the future.

A "Public Notice" is issued for a Person if an exact copy of this document (or a link to pointing to an exact copy of this document), the Person's name, contact information for the Person, and the information are made Publicly Available in such way and location as to give reasonable notice of the issuance of the license under this document, who the Person is, how to contact the Person with a written message, and that the Person endorses the accuracy and representation of any information affixed to the notice.

A Person "Publicly Licenses" their IP under this document if that Person makes a Public Notice for themself.

The "Supporting Jurisdictions" of a requirement are the jurisdictions that recognize the requirement as legally valid and enforceable.

A requirement of the form "If a given condition happens, then Your permissions Require event(s)" refers to a situation when a) the permissions granted to You by all licenses issued under this document terminate immediately in the Supporting Jurisdictions of the requirement if any of the event(s) have not occurred and b) they will be reinstated immediately in the Supporting Jurisdictions of the requirement when each of the event(s) occur assuming there are no other condition(s) causing Your permissions to be terminated.

An action is a "Publicly Restricted Action" ("Commercially Restricted Action") if a) it is a Restricted Action and b) the action is performed publicly (or commercially).  Depending on the jurisdiction, Publicly Restricted Actions might include (but not be limited to) distributing, communicating, performing, displaying, and broadcasting certain objects and Commercially Restricted Actions might include (but not be limited to) renting, offering to rent, selling, or offering to sell certain objects.

The "Permitting Licences" of an action are the licenses the Person that performed the action invokes that justifies their permission of the action.

**Acceptance**

When a Licensor Publicly Licenses their IP under this document, they accept that You receive this license if and only if You accept to be bound by this document (and thus this license) as a whole.  If You do not accept to be bound by this license as a whole, then this license grants you no permissions to perform any actions.  Therefore, if You perform a Restricted Action, then You indicate Your acceptance of this license in every jurisdiction that recognizes the action is a Restricted Action.

Instead of defining terms for this license, this document establishes when and where Your permissions are granted or terminated.  Therefore, this license cannot be breached, and the Licensors reserve the right to seek judicial remedies for intellectual property infringement if You perform a Restricted Action when Your permissions are terminated.

**Grant**

All permissions granted by this license are provided royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable for the maximum duration permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction.  In every respective jurisdiction without exceptions, limitations, or requirements except for those explicitly specified by this document, each Licensor hereby permits You to perform any action involving any object for any purpose that a) would otherwise infringe on their existing or future IP and b) would not cause this license to be void, invalid, or unenforceable.

**Reciprocity**

If the action "You offer to license a particular right" is a Restricted Action in a given jurisdiction, then You may only offer to license that right in that jurisdiction by Publicly Licensing Your IP under this document.  If You offer to license that right in any other way, then Your permissions Require You ensure that no one can reasonably believe that license is not void.

You may only offer to assign a right to a) People in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the action "You offer to assign the right" as a Restricted Action or b) to a Person has Publicly Licensed their IP under this document.  If You offer to assign that right to any other Person, then Your permissions Require You ensure that Person cannot reasonably believe they were or will be assigned the right.

**Requirement to Publicly License IP**

If You perform a Publicly Restricted Action, a Commercially Restricted Action, or a Judicial Action, then Your rights Require that You a) Publicly License Your IP under this document and b) notify the Licensors with a copy of or link to a Public Notice you issued via the contact information they provided in a Public Notice.

**Multilateral Contract**

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, the licenses granted under this document will in aggregate be interpreted as a multilateral contract among the People that Publicly License their IP under this document.  The parties of the multilateral contract each receive substantial consideration by the existing and future IP permissions freely granted to them as specified by this document. If You Publicly License Your IP under this document, then Your permissions Require that You agree to irrevocably enter into the multilateral contract defined by this document.

**Public Notices**

If You have Publicly Licensed Your IP under this document and You issue a Public notice, then Your permissions Require that the name, contact information, and included information are accurate and not misleading.

If You have Publicly Licensed Your IP under this document and You perform a Publicly Restricted action or a Commercially Restricted action to a group of People, then Your permissions Require that those People receive a copy of or link to a Public Notice including a) the notices of the Permitting Licences of that action with any information pertaining to their respective licensors and b) Your name and contact information for You if those People would need Your permission to perform the same action.

**Judicial Action**

If You have Publicly Licensed Your IP under this document and You perform a Judicial Action, then Your permissions Require that You accept that a) the prevailing party will be entitled to recover all its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action and any appeal of such action and b) the action may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction in which a defendant resides or conducts its primary business under the laws of that jurisdiction.

**Disclaimer**

All objects the Licensors have or will make Publicly Available are "as-is" and "as-available".  You bear the risk of all actions performed involving them.  To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, the Licensors disclaim all representations, guarantees, duties, liabilities, and obligations that otherwise would or will exist in any legal theory or source of law due to any Publicly Licensed IP or objects made Publicly Available.

**Interpretation**

This document defines precisely what You and the Licensors are bound to under this license.  All other agreements are separate from and independent from this license.

In each respective jurisdiction, this license does not, and will not be interpreted to, limit any action that could lawfully be performed or require any action that could lawfully not be performed if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, this license and the Public Availability of any object does not, and will not be interpreted to, imply any license of rights, a grant of permission for any action, forgiveness of or consent to any event that would justify a judicial (legal, equitable, or otherwise) remedy not relying on an IP infringement claim, or assignment of any ownership not expressed in this document.

This license is not severable.  If in a given jurisdiction this license is found to be void, invalid, or unenforceable, then a new document will be drafted that Licensors can choose to adopt.
