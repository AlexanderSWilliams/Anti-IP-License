# Anti-IP License
**Draft version**:  The license that will maximize intellectual property right inclusivity.

**Purpose**

The community of people that choose to license their rights under this document should expect that no one in the community will seek legal remedies for intellectual property infringement from them and that any such remedy will be judged in favor of the defendant(s).  To protect their cultural, literary, artistic, scientific, industrial, economic, and moral interests in their intellectual property those that license their rights under this document are expected to use voluntary arbitration, explicit contracts, insurance, 3rd party certification, ostracism, boycotting, reputation, marketing, private unions, and other voluntary measures not involving courts of law.

**Definitions**

"You" ("Your") refers to the individual or entity exercising a right granted by this license.

A "Licensor" refers to an individual or entity licensing rights under this license.

A "Copyright-likeable object" in a given jurisdiction is an object in which a "Copyright-like holder" owns exclusive rights to the reproduction and distribution of the object potentially subject to exceptions, limitations, and requirements.

A "Restricted object" in a given jurisdiction is a Copyright-likeable object in which a Licensor is a Copyright-like holder.

An object is made "Publicly available" if the object is available in such a way that members of the public can access the object from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

Rights are "Publicly Licensed" under this document including Restricted object(s) if a) this document (or a link to TBD), b) the names of those licensing their rights with respective contact information for them, and c) copies of the Restricted object(s) (or sufficient material to enable the reproduction of those Restricted object(s)) are made Publicly available in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the issuance of the license under this document, who the Licensors are, how to contact the Licensors with a written notice, and that Licensors have exclusive rights in the included Restricted object(s).

"IP" refers broadly to all exclusive rights that are recognized as intellectual property in their respective jurisdictions.  Depending on the jurisdiction, these rights include but are not limited to industrial property such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, service marks, layout-designs, commercial names and designations, geographical indications, anti-circumvention, and protection against unfair competition in addition to copyright, authors' rights, moral rights, related rights, database rights, data rights, publicity rights, privacy rights, all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields, and all rights with similar intent that exist now or in the future.

An action and an object are "Restricted" in a given jurisdiction if a Licensor has an exclusive IP to exclude people from performing the action involving the object.

A "Restricted right" in a given jurisdiction is any IP belonging to a Licensor to perform a Restricted action involving a Restricted object for some purpose.  As an example, all copyrights in derivative works of original works owned by a Licensor are restricted rights unless some of those rights have been "dual-licensed".

A right is "Publicly exclusive" in a given jurisdiction if it excludes people from performing an action involving an object publicly or commercially but does not exclude anyone from performing the action involving the object privately and noncommercially.  Depending on the jurisdiction, the excluded actions of Publicly exclusive rights might include (but are not be limited to) renting, offering to rent, selling, offering to sell, distributing, communicating, performing, displaying, or broadcasting.

An action involving an object is a "Publicly Restricted" action in a given jurisdiction if there is someone that would infringe on a Licensor's Publicly exclusive IP assuming a) that person does not have the permissions granted by this license and b) that person performed the action involving the object.

A Restricted object is "Public Restricted" in a given jurisdiction if a Publicly Restricted action is performed including the Restricted object.  As an example, in some jurisdictions if a derivative work of an original work owned by a Licensor is publicly distributed and rights to the original work are not "dual-licensed", then the derivative work is a Public Restricted object.

**Acceptance**

In order to receive this license, You must agree to its rules. The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to Your license. You must not do anything with the licensed IP that triggers a rule that You cannot or will not follow.

**Grant**

All rights granted by this license are Publicly Licensed and are provided royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, and irrevocable for the maximum duration permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction.  In every respective jurisdiction without exceptions, limitations, or requirements except for those explicitly specified by this document, each Licensor hereby grants You the right to perform any action including any object for any purpose that a) would otherwise infringe on their existing or future IP and b) would not cause this license to be void, invalid, or unenforceable.

**Copyleft**

Restricted rights may only be granted if they are Publicly Licensed under this document.  Restricted rights may only be assigned to a person or entity that has Publicly Licensed their rights under this document.

**Public Requirement**

If You own exclusive IP to a Public Restricted object, You must either a) Publicly License Your rights under this document including a copy of the Restricted object (or sufficient material to enable the reproduction of the Restricted object) or b) assign all Your exclusive IP in that object to a person or entity that has Publicly Licensed their rights under this document.

**Notice**

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of any Restricted object from You, with or without changes, receives it in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the issuance of the license under this document, who the Licensors are, how to contact the Licensors with a written notice, and that Licensors have exclusive rights in the included Restricted object(s).

**Excuse**

If anyone notifies You in writing that You have not complied with the requirements and limitations specified by this document, You can keep Your license by complying within 30 days after the notice. If You do not do so, the rights granted to You by this all licenses issued under this document shall terminate immediately.  If the rights granted to You by a license under this document terminates, they shall be reinstated immediately once You comply with the requirements and restrictions specified by this document.

**Disclaimer**

All objects the Licensors have or will make Publicly available are "as-is" and "as-available".  You bear the risk of using them.  To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, the Licensors disclaim all representations, guarantees, duties, liabilities, and obligations that otherwise would or will exist in any legal theory or source of law due to any Publicly licensed rights or objects made Publicly available.  No one shall be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions unless those are expressly agreed upon.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the granted rights not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this license.

**Interpretation**

For the avoidance of doubt, this license does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of any object that could lawfully be used without permission under this license.

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, this license and the Public availability of any object does not, and shall not be interpreted to, imply any granting of rights, permitting of any actions, or assignment of any ownership not expressed in this document.

This license is not severable.  If in a given jurisdiction, this license is found to be void, invalid, or unenforceable, then a new document will be drafted that Licensors can choose to adopt.

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, this license shall be interpreted as a bilateral contract between each pair of licensors and licensees.  As more people choose to license their rights under this document, the reciprocal nature of the document establishes significant benefits for those that comply with the license's requirements and limitations, and it establishes significant detriments for those that do not comply.
