# Anti-IP License
**Draft version**:  The license that will maximize intellectual property rights inclusivity.

**Purpose**

The community of people that choose to license their rights under this document and comply with its requirements should expect that no one in the community will seek a judicial remedy for intellectual property infringement from them and that any such claim will be judged in favor of the defendant(s).  To protect their cultural, literary, artistic, scientific, industrial, economic, and moral interests in their intellectual property those that license their rights under this document are expected to use voluntary arbitration, explicit contracts, insurance, 3rd party certification, ostracism, boycotting, reputation, marketing, private unions, and other voluntary measures not involving courts of law.

**Definitions**

"IP" refers broadly to all exclusive rights that are recognized as intellectual property in their respective jurisdictions.  Depending on the jurisdiction, these rights include but are not limited to industrial property such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, service marks, layout-designs, commercial names and designations, geographical indications, anti-circumvention, and protection against unfair competition in addition to copyright, authors' rights, moral rights, related rights, database rights, data rights, publicity rights, privacy rights, all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields, and all rights with similar intent that exist now or in the future.

A "Person" ("People") refers to an individual or entity.

A "Licensor" refers to a Person granting permissions under this license.

"You" ("Your") refers to a Person that performed or is performing an action that would infringe on a Licensor's IP if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

"Excluded IP" is all IP that would exclude You from performing an action if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

A "Copyright-liked" object in a given jurisdiction is an object in which a "Copyright-like holder" owns IP to the reproduction and distribution of the object potentially subject to exceptions, limitations, and requirements.

A "Patent-liked" object in a given jurisdiction is an object in which a "Patent-like holder" owns IP to the production and distribution of copies of the object potentially subject to exceptions, limitations, and requirements.  In some jurisdictions, an object might be Patent-liked and not Copyright-liked due to various doctrines such as independent discovery and the ideaâ€“expression distinction that are inherent in the right of reproduction.

A "Restricted object" in a given jurisdiction is a Copyright-liked object in which a Licensor is a Copyright-like holder or a Patent-liked object in which a Licensor is a Patent-like holder.

An object is made "Publicly available" if the object is available in such a way that members of the public can access the object from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

A notice is "Sufficient" if it is provided in such way and location as to give reasonable notice of the issuance of the license under this document, who the Licensors are, how to contact the Licensors with a written message, and what IP the Licensors claim to own in all (if any) included Restricted object(s).

Rights are "Publicly Licensed" under this document including Restricted object(s) if a) an exact copy of this document (or a link to pointing to an exact copy of this document) and b) the names of those licensing their rights with respective contact information for them are made Publicly available as a Sufficient notice.

A "Restricted action" in a given jurisdiction is an action involving a Restricted object that People are excluded from performing due to a Licensor's IP.

A "Restricted right" in a given jurisdiction is any IP belonging to a Licensor to perform a Restricted action involving a Restricted object.

A right is "Publicly exclusive" in a given jurisdiction if it excludes People from performing an action involving an object publicly or commercially but does not exclude any Person from performing the action involving the object privately and noncommercially.  Depending on the jurisdiction, the excluded actions of Publicly exclusive rights might include (but are not be limited to) renting, offering to rent, selling, offering to sell, distributing, communicating, performing, displaying, and broadcasting.

An action involving an object is a "Publicly Restricted" action in a given jurisdiction if there is a Person that would infringe on a Licensor's Publicly exclusive IP assuming a) that Person does not have the permissions granted by this license and b) that Person performed the action involving the object.

A Restricted object is "Public Restricted" in a given jurisdiction if a Publicly Restricted action is performed involving the Restricted object.  As an example, in some jurisdictions, if a derivative work of an original work owned by a Licensor is publicly distributed and the right to create the derivative work was exercised under this license, then the derivative work is a Public Restricted object.

The "Supporting Jurisdictions" of a condition are the jurisdictions that would that recognize the condition as legally valid.  For example, the Supporting Jurisdictions of the condition "You distributed a Restricted object" are the jurisdictions that recognize the object as a Restricted object and that You performed or are performing an action that would infringe on a Licensor's IP if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

A statement of the form "If a given condition happens, then Your permissions Require event(s)" refers to a situation when a) the permissions granted to You by all licenses issued under this document shall terminate immediately in the Supporting Jurisdictions of the condition if any of the event(s) have not occurred and b) they shall be reinstated immediately in the Supporting Jurisdictions of the condition when each of the the event(s) occur.

**Acceptance**

When the Licensor(s) Publicly License their rights under this document, they accept that You receive this license if and only if You accept to be bound by this document (and thus this license) as a whole.  If You do not accept to be bound by this license as a whole, then this license grants you no permissions to perform any actions.  Therefore, if You perform a Restricted action involving a Restricted object, then You indicate Your acceptance of this license in every jurisdiction that recognizes the action and the object as Restricted.

Instead of defining terms for this license, this document establishes when and where Your permissions are granted or terminated.  Therefore, this license cannot be breached, and the Licensors reserve the right to seek judicial remedies for intellectual property infringement if You perform a Restricted action with a Restricted object when Your permissions are terminated.

**Grant**

All permissions granted by this license are provided royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, and irrevocable for the maximum duration permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction.  In every respective jurisdiction without exceptions, limitations, or requirements except for those explicitly specified by this document, each Licensor hereby grants You the permission to perform any action involving any object for any purpose that a) would otherwise infringe on their existing or future IP and b) would not cause this license to be void, invalid, or unenforceable.

**Distribution**

If a Person receives a copy or reproduction of any Restricted object from You, then Your permissions Require that Person also receives a Sufficient notice.

**Public License**

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, the licenses granted under this document will in aggregate be interpreted as a multilateral contract among the People that Publicly License their rights under this document.  The parties of the multilateral contract each receive substantial consideration by the current and future IP permissions freely granted to them as specified by this document.  If You Publicly License Your rights under this document, then Your permissions Require that a) the names and contact information You provide are accurate and not misleading and b) that You agree to irrevocably enter into the multilateral contract defined by this document.

If You Publicly License Your rights including any Restricted objects(s), then Your permissions Require You to a) notify each Licensor of the location of Your license notice via the respective contact information they provided and b) include the names and the contact information of each Licensor with Your name and contact information in the Public License.  

**Copyleft**

You may only license Restricted rights by Publicly Licensing Your rights under this document.  If you offer to license Restricted rights in any other way, then Your permissions Require You ensure that no one can reasonably believe a) they were or will be offered that license and b) that license is not void.

You may only assign Restricted rights to a person or entity that has Publicly Licensed their rights under this document.  If you offer to assign Restricted rights to any other person or entity, then Your permissions Require You ensure that no one can reasonably believe they were or will be assigned the Restricted rights.

**Public Requirement**

If You own IP to a Public Restricted object, then Your permissions Require You to Publicly License Your rights including the Restricted object.

**Judicial Remedy**

If You take any action to enforce the terms of this license or to seek a judicial remedy relating to this license or any objects the Licensors have made Publicly available, then Your permissions Require that You a) Publicly License Your rights including any Restricted object(s) mentioned in your claim(s) and b) accept that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action and any appeal of such action.

**Disclaimer**

All objects the Licensors have or will make Publicly available are "as-is" and "as-available".  You bear the risk of all actions performed involving them.  To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, the Licensors disclaim all representations, guarantees, duties, liabilities, and obligations that otherwise would or will exist in any legal theory or source of law due to any Publicly Licensed rights or objects made Publicly available.

**Interpretation**

This document defines precisely what You and the Licensors are bound to under this license.  All other agreements are separate from and independent from this license.

In each respective jurisdiction, this license does not, and shall not be interpreted to, limit any action that could lawfully be performed or require any action that could lawfully not be performed if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, this license and the Public availability of any object does not, and shall not be interpreted to, imply any license of rights, a grant of permission for any action, forgiveness of or consent to any event that would justify a judicial (legal, equitable, or otherwise) remedy not relying on an IP infringement claim, or assignment of any ownership not expressed in this document.

This license is not severable.  If in a given jurisdiction this license is found to be void, invalid, or unenforceable, then a new document will be drafted that Licensors can choose to adopt.
