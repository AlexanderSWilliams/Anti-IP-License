# Anti-IP License
**Draft version**:  The license will maximize the IP rights of the public.

**Purpose**

With this license, the owners of the included intellectual property give everyone as much permission to work with all of the owners' intellectual property as possible, while protecting the owners from liability and fraud.

**Acceptance**

In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules. The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license. You must not do anything with the licensed intellectual property that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

**Grant**

Each owner licenses you to do everything with any intellectual property they can or will be able to license that would otherwise infringe that owner's intellectual property rights in it.

**Copyleft**

If you own a derivative work of any intellectual property granted to you by this license that would otherwise infringe on intellectual property rights, then you may only license that derivative work under this license.  If the such a derivative work is publicly distributed, performed, displayed, or transmitted, then you must either assign the work to the owners of the included intellectual property or grant the public rights to the work under this license.

**Notices**

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of intellectual property granted under this license from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license or a link to TBD.

**Excuse**

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with Notices or the Copyleft conditions, you can keep your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice. If you do not do so, your license ends immediately.

**No Fraud**

If you are found guilty of committing fraud using any of the intellectual property granted to you by this license in a court of law, then your license ends immediately.

**Reliability**

No owner can revoke this license.

**No Liability**

As far as the law allows, all of the licensed intellectual property that you possess comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no owner will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this property or this license, under any kind of legal claim.
