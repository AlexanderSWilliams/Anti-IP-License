# Anti-IP License
**Draft version**:  The license will maximize the intellectual property rights of the public.

**Purpose**

The community of people that choose to license their rights under this license should expect that no one in the community will sue them for intellectual property infringement and that any such lawsuit will be dismissed.

**Definitions**

"IP" refers broadly to all rights in the scope of intellectual property that are and will be recognized by the World Intellectual Property Organization and all courts of law that recognize intellectual property.  These rights include but are not limited to copyright, patent, anti-circumvention, design rights, trademarks, trade secrets, trade dress, moral rights, related rights, database rights, data rights, publicity rights, privacy rights, fair competition rights, all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields, and all rights with similar intent that exist now or in the future.

"Licensable IP" means all IP the owners of the included work can or will be able to license.  This includes all IP related and unrelated to the included work.

“Restricted work” refers to any derivative work of any Licensable IP that would otherwise infringe on an owner's IP rights.

"Public Restricted work" is any "Restricted work" that was publicly distributed, communicated, performed, displayed, transmitted, or made available.

**Acceptance**

In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules. The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license. You must not do anything with the licensed IP that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

**Grant**

Each owner grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to do everything with all their Licensable IP without restriction except for the requirements specified by this document.

**Copyleft**

Restricted works may only be licensed under this document.  Restricted works may only be assigned to someone that has publicly licensed IP under this document.

**Public Restricted work**

If you own a Public Restricted work, you must either assign the work to someone that has publicly licensed IP under this document or grant everyone rights to the work under this document.

**Notice**

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of IP granted under this document from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this document or a link to TBD.

**Excuse**

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with the requirements and restrictions specified by this document, you can keep your license by complying within 30 days after the notice. If you do not do so, your license terminates immediately.

**No Fraud**

No Licensable IP or Restricted work may be used to commit fraud. If you are found guilty of committing fraud using any of the Licensable IP or a Restricted work in a court of law, then your license ends immediately.

**Reliability**

This license may not be revoked or canceled.

**Disclaimer**

All IP granted under this license is "as-is".  You bear the risk of using it.  To the extent permitted by law, the owners disclaim all representations, warranties, guarantees, responsibilities, liabilities, and obligations that otherwise would or will exist.
