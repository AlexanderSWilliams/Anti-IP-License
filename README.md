# Anti-IP License
**Draft version**:  The license that will maximize intellectual property right inclusivity.

**Purpose**

The community of people that choose to license their rights under this document should expect that no one in the community will seek a judicial remedy for intellectual property infringement from them and that any such claim will be judged in favor of the defendant(s).  To protect their cultural, literary, artistic, scientific, industrial, economic, and moral interests in their intellectual property those that license their rights under this document are expected to use voluntary arbitration, explicit contracts, insurance, 3rd party certification, ostracism, boycotting, reputation, marketing, private unions, and other voluntary measures not involving courts of law.

**Definitions**

"IP" refers broadly to all exclusive rights that are recognized as intellectual property in their respective jurisdictions.  Depending on the jurisdiction, these rights include but are not limited to industrial property such as patents, industrial designs, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, service marks, layout-designs, commercial names and designations, geographical indications, anti-circumvention, and protection against unfair competition in addition to copyright, authors' rights, moral rights, related rights, database rights, data rights, publicity rights, privacy rights, all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields, and all rights with similar intent that exist now or in the future.

A "Licensor" refers to an individual or entity granting permissions under this license.

"You" ("Your") refers to an individual or entity that performed or is performing an action that would infringe on a Licensor's IP if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

"Excluded IP" is all IP that would exclude You from performing an action if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

A "Copyright-liked" object in a given jurisdiction is an object in which a "Copyright-like holder" owns exclusive rights to the reproduction and distribution of the object potentially subject to exceptions, limitations, and requirements.

A "Patent-liked" object in a given jurisdiction is an object in which a "Patent-like holder" owns exclusive rights to the production and distribution of reproductions of the object potentially subject to exceptions, limitations, and requirements.  In some jurisdictions, an object might be Patent-liked and not Copyright-liked due to considerations of independent discovery.

A "Restricted object" in a given jurisdiction is a Copyright-liked object in which a Licensor is a Copyright-like holder or a Patent-liked object in which a Licensor is a Patent-like holder.

An object is made "Publicly available" if the object is available in such a way that members of the public can access the object from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

Rights are "Publicly Licensed" under this document including Restricted object(s) if a) this document (or a link to TBD), b) the names of those licensing their rights with respective contact information for them, and c) copies of the Restricted object(s) (or sufficient material to enable the production or reproduction of those Restricted object(s)) are made Publicly available in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the issuance of the license under this document, who the Licensors are, how to contact the Licensors with a written notice, and that Licensors have exclusive rights in the included Restricted object(s).

A "Restricted action" in a given jurisdiction is an action involving a Restricted object that people are excluded from performing due to a Licensor's IP.

A "Restricted right" in a given jurisdiction is any IP belonging to a Licensor to perform a Restricted action involving a Restricted object for some purpose.

A right is "Publicly exclusive" in a given jurisdiction if it excludes people from performing an action involving an object publicly or commercially but does not exclude anyone from performing the action involving the object privately and noncommercially.  Depending on the jurisdiction, the excluded actions of Publicly exclusive rights might include (but are not be limited to) renting, offering to rent, selling, offering to sell, distributing, communicating, performing, displaying, and broadcasting.

An action involving an object is a "Publicly Restricted" action in a given jurisdiction if there is someone that would infringe on a Licensor's Publicly exclusive IP assuming a) that person does not have the permissions granted by this license and b) that person performed the action involving the object.

A Restricted object is "Public Restricted" in a given jurisdiction if a Publicly Restricted action is performed including the Restricted object.  As an example, in some jurisdictions if a derivative work of an original work owned by a Licensor is publicly distributed and rights to the original work are not "dual-licensed", then the derivative work is a Public Restricted object.

**Acceptance**

In order to receive this license, You must agree to its rules. The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to Your license. You must not do anything with the licensed IP that triggers a rule that You cannot or will not follow.

**Grant**

All rights granted by this license are Publicly Licensed and are provided royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, and irrevocable for the maximum duration permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction.  In every respective jurisdiction without exceptions, limitations, or requirements except for those explicitly specified by this document, each Licensor hereby grants You the right to perform any action including any object for any purpose that a) would otherwise infringe on their existing or future IP and b) would not cause this license to be void, invalid, or unenforceable.

**Copyleft**

You may only license Restricted rights if they are Publicly Licensed under this document.  You may only assign Restricted rights to a person or entity that has Publicly Licensed their rights under this document.

**Public Requirement**

If You own exclusive IP to a Public Restricted object, You must either a) Publicly License Your rights under this document including a copy of the Restricted object (or sufficient material to enable the reproduction of the Restricted object) or b) assign all Your exclusive IP in that object to a person or entity that has Publicly Licensed their rights under this document.

**Notice**

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of any Restricted object from You, with or without changes, receives it in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the issuance of the license under this document, who the Licensors are, how to contact the Licensors with a written notice, and that Licensors have exclusive rights in the included Restricted object(s).

**Excuse**

If anyone notifies You in writing that You have not complied with the requirements and limitations specified by this document, You can keep Your license by complying within 30 days after the notice. If You do not do so, the rights granted to You by all licenses issued under this document shall terminate immediately.  If the rights granted to You by a license under this document terminates, they shall be reinstated immediately once You comply with the requirements and restrictions specified by this document.

**Disclaimer**

All objects the Licensors have or will make Publicly available are "as-is" and "as-available".  You bear the risk of all actions performed involving them.  To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, the Licensors disclaim all representations, guarantees, duties, liabilities, and obligations that otherwise would or will exist in any legal theory or source of law due to any Publicly licensed rights or objects made Publicly available.

**Interpretation**

Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the licensed rights, granted permissions, or the requirements and restrictions of this license not stated in this document are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this license.  No one shall be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions unless those are expressly agreed upon. 

In each respective jurisdiction, this license does not, and shall not be interpreted to, limit any action that could lawfully be performed or require any action that could lawfully not be performed if the permissions granted by this license were not granted.

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, this license and the Public availability of any object does not, and shall not be interpreted to, imply any license of rights, a grant of permission for any action, forgiveness of or consent to any event that would justify a judicial (legal, equitable, or otherwise) remedy not relying on an IP infringement claim, or assignment of any ownership not expressed in this document.

This license is not severable.  If in a given jurisdiction this license is found to be void, invalid, or unenforceable, then a new document will be drafted that Licensors can choose to adopt.

To the maximum extent permitted by law in each respective jurisdiction, this license shall be interpreted as a bilateral contract between each pair of licensors and licensees.  As more people choose to license their rights under this document, the reciprocal nature of the document establishes significant benefits for those that comply with the license's requirements and limitations, and it establishes significant detriments for those that do not comply.
